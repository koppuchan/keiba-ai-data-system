REM ============================================================================
REM Task Scheduler entry point for the 6-factor scoring batch.
REM
REM Computes the 6 factors for today's runners from the backfilled local SQLite
REM (data\historical.sqlite3) and pushes them to WordPress as hrc_factors.
REM Meant to run several times a day (e.g. every 3 hours) so that whichever run
REM lands after that day's race cards are posted picks them up within a few
REM hours - a run that finds no races yet simply does nothing and exits 0.
REM
REM Differences from run-score.bat, which is for interactive use:
REM   - No "pause" at the end. A scheduled task that waits for a key press
REM     never finishes, so the task would stay Running forever and later
REM     triggers would be skipped.
REM   - Appends stdout/stderr to a dated log file under logs\, since a
REM     scheduled task has no console to read.
REM   - Propagates the exit code so Task Scheduler's Last Run Result is
REM     meaningful (0 = success).
REM
REM NOTE: keep this file ASCII-only - see the comment in run-watch.bat for why.

REM Date-stamped log name. %DATE% is locale-dependent and wmic is absent on
REM newer Windows builds, so ask PowerShell for an unambiguous yyyyMMdd.
for /f %%d in ('powershell -NoProfile -Command "Get-Date -Format yyyyMMdd"') do set LOGDATE=%%d
set LOGFILE=logs\score-%LOGDATE%.log

REM Use an explicit path, and send call's own output to the log so an encoding
REM problem in secrets.local.bat is recorded rather than lost.
call "%~dp0secrets.local.bat" >> "%LOGFILE%" 2>&1

REM If secrets.local.bat is malformed (UTF-8 Japanese comments or LF-only line
REM endings), cmd misparses it and the set lines never run - which would then
REM fail much later with a confusing WordPress/JV-Link auth error. Fail fast.
if not defined JvLinkSoftwareId (
    echo [ERROR] JvLinkSoftwareId is not set. secrets.local.bat did not apply. >> "%LOGFILE%"

    exit /b 1
)

REM Invoke the exe by its full path rather than relying on the current
REM directory being searched: that search is disabled when the environment sets
REM NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath=1, and a scheduled task does not
REM necessarily inherit the same environment as an interactive shell.

)

REM Keep the working directory next to the exe; some COM components resolve
REM their own relative paths against it.
REM
REM %1 is an optional yyyy-MM-dd date, forwarded straight through to
REM "score" (see Program.cs). Left blank for the normal scheduled runs,
REM which score today as always; only set when manually re-running a
REM past day (e.g. after the day rolled over past a run that crashed).
